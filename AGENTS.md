## Setup commands

- No setup needed.
- Run tests: `pixi run test`. Do not run "cd", assume you are in the correct path by default.

## Code style

- When writing Python, conform to PEP8 with maximum line length of 79 chars
- Keep cyclomatic complexity low. Write small, testable functions
- Never mark your changes with inline comments. Code is for clean, final implementation only
- Retain exiting formatting, docstrings, and comments
- Do not put file start markers into code blocks

## Other rules

- Do not make changes unrelated to the current task
- Never remove logging or debugging unless asked by the user
- Do not repeat files unless they have changes
