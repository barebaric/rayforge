    The canonical coordinate system for all local vector geometry.

    This is the standard space for `workpiece.vectors` and any scalable ops

    - **Unit**: Millimeters (mm).

    - **Orientation**: Y-axis pointing upwards (a standard Cartesian system).
    - **Use**: This is the contract for importers and for producers that
      output scalable vector geometry (`is_scalable=True`). The
