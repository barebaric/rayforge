# The bundled ezdxf wheel has a compiled dependency on the NumPy C-API.
# The standard debhelper tools do not automatically detect this for pre-compiled
# binaries installed via pip. However, our explicit dependency on 'python3-numpy'
# in debian/control satisfies this requirement in practice.
# We are overriding this lintian error to acknowledge we have handled it.
