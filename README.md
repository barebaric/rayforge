| **Multi-Layer Operations**   | Assign different operations (e.g., engrave then cut) to layers in your design.                                   |
| **Versatile Operations**     | Supports Contour, Raster Engraving (with cross-hatch fill), Shrink Wrap, and Depth Engraving.                    |
| **Overscan & Kerf Comp.**    | Improve engraving quality with overscan and ensure dimensional accuracy with kerf compensation.                  |
| **2.5D Cutting**             | Perform multi-pass cuts with a configurable step-down between each pass for thick materials.                     |
| **3D G-code Preview**        | Visualize G-code toolpaths in 3D to verify the job before sending it to the machine.                             |
| **Multi-Machine Profiles**   | Configure and instantly switch between multiple machine profiles.                                                |

| **Advanced Path Generation** | High-quality image tracing, travel time optimization, path smoothing, and spot size interpolation.               |
| **Holding Tabs**             | Add tabs to contour cuts to hold pieces in place. Supports manual and automatic placement.                       |
| **G-code Macros & Hooks**    | Run custom G-code snippets before/after jobs. Supports variable substitution.                                    |
| **Broad File Support**       | Import from SVG, DXF, PDF, JPEG, PNG, BMP, and even Ruida files (`.rd`).                                         |
| **Multi-Laser Operations**   | Choose different lasers for each operation in a job                                                              |
| **Camera Integration**       | Use a USB camera for workpiece alignment, positioning, and background tracing.                                   |
