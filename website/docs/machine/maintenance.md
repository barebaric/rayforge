## Hour Counters

Rayforge tracks how long your machine has been in use. These counters help you schedule preventive maintenance.

### Laser Hours

- Schedule laser tube replacement (CO2 tubes typically last 1000-3000 hours)
- Monitor laser diode degradation
- Track warranty periods

### Job Hours

Tracks the total time spent running jobs, including travel moves. Use this to:

- Schedule belt tensioning
- Plan bearing lubrication
- Track overall machine usage

### Movement Hours

Tracks the time spent moving (not cutting). Use this to:

- Schedule stepper motor maintenance
- Plan rail cleaning and lubrication

## Resetting Counters
