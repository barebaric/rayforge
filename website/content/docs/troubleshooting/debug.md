# Troubleshooting & Reporting Issues

If you're experiencing problems with Rayforge, especially with connecting to or controlling your machine, we're here to help. The best way to get support is by providing a detailed debug report. Rayforge has a built-in tool that makes this easy.

## How to Create a Debug Report

Follow these simple steps to generate and share a report:

#### 1. Open the Log Viewer

At the bottom of the main window, you'll find the status bar. The left section shows the current connection status (e.g., "Connected", "Disconnected"). **Click on the connection status in the status bar** to open the Log Viewer panel.

#### 2. Save the Report

In the Log Viewer panel, click the **Save** button. This will package all the necessary diagnostic information into a single `.zip` file. Save this file to a memorable location, like your Desktop.

#### 3. Create a GitHub Issue

Go to our [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/barebaric/rayforge/issues/new/choose) and create a new issue. Please provide a clear title and a detailed description of the problem:

- **What did you do?** (e.g., "I tried to connect to my laser after starting the app.")
- **What did you expect to happen?** (e.g., "I expected it to connect successfully.")
- **What actually happened?** (e.g., "It stayed disconnected and the log showed timeout errors.")

#### 4. Attach the Report

**Drag and drop the `.zip` file** you saved into the description box of the GitHub issue. This will upload and attach it to your report.

## What's in the Debug Report?

The generated `.zip` file contains technical information that helps us diagnose the problem quickly. It includes:

- **Machine & Application Settings:** Your saved machine configurations and application preferences, which helps us reproduce your setup.
- **Communication Logs:** A detailed record of the data sent between Rayforge and your laser.
- **System Information:** Your operating system and the versions of Rayforge and key libraries installed.
- **Application State:** Other internal information that can help pinpoint the source of an error.

> **Privacy Note:** The report **does not** include any of your design files (SVGs, DXFs, etc.) or personal operating system data. It only contains information directly related to the Rayforge application and its connection to your laser.
