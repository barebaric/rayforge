Rayforge 1.1 brings a powerful new G-code console, unified raster operations,
and a completely rebuilt data pipeline for improved performance and stability.

## MacOS Support

Thanks to the incredible work of GitHub user **pgilfernandez**, Rayforge
now officially supports macOS! Both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs are
supported. This has been a long-requested feature, and we're thrilled to
welcome Mac users to the Rayforge community.

## The Big Story: Complete Pipeline Rewrite

The headline feature of this release is a complete rewrite of the data
pipeline backend. The new architecture is based on a Directed Acyclic Graph
(DAG), which brings significant improvements:

- **Better performance** for complex projects with many operations
- **Reduced memory usage** through more efficient data handling
- **Smoother UI responsiveness** during heavy processing
- **Fixed memory leaks** that affected long editing sessions

This foundational upgrade makes Rayforge more robust and prepares the
codebase for future features.

## Unified Raster Operations

The old "raster", "depth", and "dither" operations have been merged into a
single, unified raster operation. This simplifies the workflow while giving
you more control:

- **Configurable line distance** in all raster operations
- **New "Raster (Dither)" operation** with configurable algorithms
- **Auto thresholding** for Variable Power and Multipass modes
- **Histogram** in the raster engraver for visual threshold setting
- **Symbolic visualization** of raster direction in the rasterizer

## G-code Console

The log view has been replaced with a fully-featured G-code terminal. You can
now send commands directly to your machine, view responses in real-time, and
interact with your laser cutter more directly than ever before.

## More New Features

### Export Support

You can now export your documents or selected objects to SVG and DXF formats.
This is great for sharing designs or using them in other software.

### Sketcher Improvements

- **Angle constraints** are now available in the parametric sketcher
- **Conflicting constraints** are highlighted in red for easier debugging

### Machine Configuration

- Axis extents, work surface, and soft limits can now be configured per machine
- Built-in G-code dialect supporting dynamic power mode

### Other Additions

- Increased maximum laser spot size to 10 mm
- `RAYFORGE_MAX_WORKERS` environment variable to limit processes
- macOS packaging scripts and resources for better platform support
- `--uiscript` CLI argument for executing scripts after the UI is up

## Bug Fixes

This release addresses many issues:

- Multiple memory leaks in the data pipeline
- Race conditions between worker pool task completion and pipeline shutdown
- Camera device scanning crash on Windows
- Multipass post-processor exception
- Rasterizer angle causing distortion
- Various macOS issues: shm_open length errors, SVG rendering fallback,
  keyboard shortcuts
- Workpiece stage not emitting correct node state
- Zoom resolution stuck until resizing at least once
- Blurry view overlay on startup
- Unresponsive serial ports now handled gracefully
