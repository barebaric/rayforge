Today marks a special milestone for Rayforge - we're releasing version
1.0 exactly on the project's first birthday! What started as a single
commit on February 1st, 2025, has grown into a fully-featured laser
cutting and engraving platform.

## The Journey So Far

Over the past year, Rayforge has evolved from a basic laser control tool
into a comprehensive design and manufacturing platform. We've built
everything from scratch: a parametric 2D CAD system, 3D G-code preview,
multi-layer support, multi-laser support, camera alignment, work
coordinate systems, and so much more.

This release represents the culmination of that vision - a stable,
production-ready tool that can handle real-world laser cutting and
engraving workflows.

## What's New in 1.0

### Project Save/Load

The most requested feature is finally here. You can now save your
complete workflows and restore them later. The `.ryp` (project) and
`.rfs` (sketch) file extensions are registered system-wide, so you can
double-click your projects to open them directly. A recent files menu
provides quick access to your work.

### Parametric Sketcher with Text Support

The sketcher now supports text with full constraint integration. Add
text to your sketches, apply aspect ratio constraints, and control
placement and sizing parametrically. This opens up a whole new world of
design possibilities for laser-engraved signs, labels, and decorative
elements.

### Unified Bottom Panel

The jog dialog and log view have been merged into a single, unified
bottom panel. This consolidation provides a cleaner workspace while
keeping essential machine control and monitoring tools readily
accessible. The panel features tabbed access to jog controls and log
output, making it easy to switch between operations without losing
screen real estate.

### Other Improvements

- **Bottom panel**: Jog dialog and log view are now merged into a
  unified bottom panel
- **Import dialog**: Errors are now collected and displayed together
- **Importers**: Almost completely rewritten for better testability
- **Sketcher stability**: Solver now biases points for more stable
  dragging
- **Bug fixes**: Multi-layer DXF import, alignment bugs, centering
  issues, and more

## Feature Highlights

Rayforge 1.0 includes over 60 features:

**Design Tools**

- Path optimization and smoothing
- Holding tabs with auto-placement

**Import/Export**

- SVG, DXF, PDF, JPEG, PNG, BMP, Ruida file support
- Vector tracing with multiple algorithms
- Image preprocessing (denoising, invert, threshold)

**Machine Control**

**Visualization**

- 3D G-code preview with full simulation
- Camera alignment
- Dark and light themes
- Multi-language support

## A Look Back

The first commit was made on February 1st, 2025, at 19:37:27. It was a
simple "initial import" with basic SVG rendering support. Since then,
we've:

- Released 28 versions (0.13 through 0.28, plus 1.0)
- Added over 60 features
- Fixed hundreds of bugs
- Built a community of users and contributors
- Created installers for Windows, Linux (deb, snap, flatpak), and macOS

## What's Next?

Version 1.0 is a milestone, not a destination. The roadmap ahead
includes:

- Enhanced vector tools and editing capabilities
- Broader hardware support
- Performance optimizations for large projects
- More machine profiles and dialects
- Community-driven package ecosystem
