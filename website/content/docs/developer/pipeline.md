# **Sequential Pipeline Architecture**

This document describes the pipeline in a linear, sequential flow, showing how
raw design data is progressively transformed into the final outputs used for
visualization and manufacturing.

# **Detailed Breakdown of the Sequence**

## **1. Input**

The process begins with the **Input**, which is the `Doc Model`. This is the
complete representation of the user's project, containing:

- **WorkPieces:** The individual design elements (like SVGs or images) that
  have been placed on the canvas.
- **Steps:** The specific instructions for how to process those WorkPieces
  (e.g., a "Contour" cut or a "Raster" engrave), including settings like
  power and speed.

## **2. The Pipeline**

The `Pipeline` is the core processing engine that runs in the background.
It takes the `Doc Model` as its input and orchestrates a series of distinct
`PipelineStage`s.

### **2a. WorkpieceGeneratorStage: Per-Item Processing**

This stage processes each `(WorkPiece, Step)` combination individually to
create a cached `WorkPieceArtifact`. This artifact contains toolpaths in the
**local coordinate system** of the workpiece. Its internal sequence is:

1.  **Modifiers:** (Optional) If the input is a raster image, modifiers
    perform initial image conditioning, such as converting it to grayscale.
2.  **Producer:** A `Producer` (like `EdgeTracer` or `Rasterizer`) analyzes
    the input and creates the raw toolpaths (`Ops`) and metadata.
3.  **Per-Workpiece Transformers:** The newly generated `Ops` are passed
    through transformers specific to that workpiece, such as adding
    holding `Tabs` or `Smooth`ing the geometry.
4.  **Vertex Encoder:** The processed `Ops` are encoded into GPU-friendly
    `Vertex Data` (for lines) and `Texture Data` (for raster fills).

The output is a **WorkPieceArtifact** stored in shared memory. This contains
un-positioned, un-rotated data ready for the next stage and for direct
consumption by the 2D canvas.

### **2b. StepGeneratorStage: Step-Level Assembly**

This stage is responsible for assembling final artifacts for an entire step. It
consumes the `WorkPieceArtifacts` for all workpieces that are part of a given
step.

1.  **Assemble & Transform:** The stage retrieves all required
    `WorkPieceArtifacts` from the cache. It then applies the final world
    transformations to each oneâ€”placing them at their correct X/Y position
    and applying rotation. All these individual toolpaths and textures are
    combined.
2.  **Per-Step Transformers:** The unified `Ops` are then processed
    by transformers that operate on the step as a whole, such as path
    `Optimize`ation or `Multi-Pass` operations.

The `StepGeneratorStage` produces two distinct outputs:

- A **StepRenderArtifact**: A lightweight "render bundle" for the 3D canvas,
  containing all vertex and texture data for the entire step in final
  **world-space** coordinates. This is delivered as quickly as possible.
- A **StepOpsArtifact**: An artifact containing only the final, transformed
  `Ops` for the entire step. This is consumed later by the job generator.

### **2c. JobGeneratorStage: Final Job Assembly**

This stage is invoked when the user wants to generate the final G-code. It
consumes the `StepOpsArtifacts` created by the `StepGeneratorStage`.

1.  **Assemble Ops & Encode:** The `JobGeneratorStage` retrieves all required
    `StepOpsArtifacts` from the cache and combines their `Ops` into a single,
    large sequence. It then encodes this sequence into G-code and generates
    a final set of vertices for simulation, along with a high-fidelity
    time estimate for the entire job.

The final output is a **JobArtifact**, which contains the complete G-code,
final vertex data, the OpMap, and the total time estimate.

## **3. Consumers**

The data generated by the pipeline is consumed by several clients, each
using the artifact best suited for its needs:

1.  **2D Canvas (UI):** Uses **WorkPieceArtifacts** directly. This allows it
    to render the local geometry of each workpiece without needing to wait
    for step-level assembly, providing fast feedback during design.

2.  **3D Canvas (UI):** Uses **StepRenderArtifacts**. These are perfect "render
    bundles" containing all the geometry for an entire step, already in
    world-space coordinates. This simplifies rendering and ensures an
    accurate preview of the final assembled output.

3.  **Simulator (UI):** Uses the **JobArtifact**. The final vertex data
    within this artifact represents the exact path the machine will take,
    allowing for an accurate, real-time simulation of the entire job from
    start to finish. It also uses the final time estimate.

4.  **G-code File (for Machine):** The **G-code** from the `JobArtifact`
    is saved to a file, which can then be sent to the laser cutter or CNC
    machine for manufacturing.
